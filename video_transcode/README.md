## Why do I want this?
Lots of video apps use FFMPEG for video manipulation tasks and while there is nothing wrong with that, there are a couple of advantages that come with using native APIs for this:

- Use H264 and HEVC codecs without licensing
- Faster by default
- Easier memory management
- Simple HDR tonemapping
- ...

## Features

### Included (basic functionality)
- [x] Trim videos
- [x] Resize video frame (so far only with BoxFit.cover)
- [x] Concat videos
- [x] Extract metadata
- [x] Generate thumbnails (rudimentary)

### Planned
-Â [ ] Resize with more fitting algorithms
- [ ] Output quality control
- [ ] Support other containers
- [ ] Filters
- [ ] macOS support

## Caveats
- For concat on Android, all videos *must* contain an audio track.
